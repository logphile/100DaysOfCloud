# Day 4 - SSH Into New Linux VM 

## Introduction

Today is Day 4 of 100 Days of Cloud. Today's post is not cloud-related per-se. While trying to remote into the new Linunx VM created in Azure I ran into an interesting problem regarding SSH, mRemoteNG and converting the Azure PEM key into a PPK (PuTTY Private Key).

## Prerequisite

Familiarity with SSH, PuTTY and mRemoteNG.

## Use Case

Being able to establish an SSH connection with a VM is important but also being able to troubleshoot issues with SSH and remote connections to a VM is even more important.

## Objective Demonstration & Screenshots

The daily objective, notes and screenshots can be seen in the blog post below.
