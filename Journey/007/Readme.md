Day 7 - Deploying AADDS

Introduction

Today is Day 7 of 100 Days of Cloud. Today's post is about deploying the Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AADDS). The prep work has been done and now AADDS can be deployed successfully with minimal hiccups.

Prerequisite

Knowledge and familiarity with the Azure portal, AADDS, Azure Vnets and subnets, and a basic understanding of DNS.

Use Case

The best way to think about AADDS is rather than have physical domain controllers on prem that need upgrades, maintenance, patching, hardware replacement, etc.; AADDS gives you cloud domain controllers that just work with none of or very little of the aforementioned responsibilities that came with an on-prem solution.

Objective Demonstration & Screenshots

The daily objective, notes and screenshots can be seen in the blog post below.
