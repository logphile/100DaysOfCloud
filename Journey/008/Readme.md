# Day 8 - Setup & Test AD Connect

## Introduction

Today is Day 8 of 100 Days of Cloud. Today's post is about setting up and configuring Azure AD Connect.

## Prerequisite

Knowledge and familiarity with the Azure portal, AD Connect, Server 2012 R2, AD FS, Powershell

## Use Case

To make users' lives easier AD Connect can be used to synchronize password hashes from the cloud to an on-premise environment so a single login/password can be used. Also, if an environment requires NTML/Kerberos, AD Connect may want to be considered for this as well.

## Objective Demonstration & Screenshots

The daily objective, notes and screenshots can be seen in the blog post below.
