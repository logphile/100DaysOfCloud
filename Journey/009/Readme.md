Day 9 - Sign Into Azure Via Local Powershell
Introduction
Today is Day 9 of 100 Days of Cloud. Today's post is about signing into Azure from a local Powershell session.

Prerequisite
A local install of Powershell 7.x.

Use Case
Most administrators prefer to use a terminal for daily operations and administrations of system when available. The Azure Cloud Shell via the Azure Portal is convenient but may lack the customization, speed and convenience of a local Powershell session.
