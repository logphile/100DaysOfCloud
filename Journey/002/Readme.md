# Day 2 - Create an Azure AD User & Enable MFA

## Introduction

Today is Day 2 of 100 Days of Cloud. While studying for AZ-104 I am thinking about and researching the best way to go about the daily challenges. Until then I will be borrowing ideas and tasks from the project authors and other sources. 

Today's task is from Gwyneth Pena via her Github (SEC04-AZ100 - Create an Azure AD user).

## Prerequisite

Familiarity with the Azure portal, Active Directory and enabling MFA within an Azure subscription.

## Use Case

This is a common task that every System Administrator will perform. Companies have employees (users). Users will need accounts to access resources.

## Objective Demonstration & Screenshots

The daily objective, notes and screenshots can be seen in the blog post below.
