# Day 2

## Introduction

Today is Day 2 of 100 Days of Cloud. 

While studying for the AZ-104 exam I am thinking about and researching the best way to go about the daily challenges. Until I figure out the best way to go about it I will be borrowing ideas and tasks from the project authors and others.

Today's task is from Gwyneth Pena via her Github.

## Prerequisite

Familiarity with the Azure portal, user creation and an understanding of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

## Social Proof

Below is a link to a post I created with an in-depth walkthrough showing my work along with screenshots. In the post I walk through creating a user and enabling MFA for the subscription.

Also provided is a link to the tweet for my Day 2 work. I have also included a more in-depth post on my blog.
