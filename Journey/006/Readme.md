# Day 6 - Adding a Custom Domain Name 

## Introduction

Today is Day 6 of 100 Days of Cloud. Today's post is about adding a Custom Domain Name for an Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AADDS) deployment. The domain I want to deploy AADDS to is not present in the tenant so I go through the process of adding the Custom Domain Name.

## Prerequisite

Knowledge and familiarity with the Azure portal, DNS and domain registrars.

## Use Case

Unless a company wants to use the default .onmicrosoft.com domain (which they won't!) a Custom Domain will need to be added to Azure Active Directory.

## Objective Demonstration & Screenshots

The daily objective, notes and screenshots can be seen in the blog post below.
